%% LATEX SETUP
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Load some packages and create settings which will be assumed to exist from
% here on out for their great utility:
  \RequirePackage{etoolbox}
  \RequirePackage{xpatch}
  \RequirePackage{ifdraft}

% We will always assume at the very least the pdfLaTeX is in use. To permit
% possible specialization for XeLaTex and LuaLaTeX, create a new boolean that
% identifies these advanced engines simultaneously.
  \RequirePackage{ifxetex}
  \RequirePackage{ifluatex}
  \newif\ifxeluatex
  \ifxetex
    \xeluatextrue
  \else
    \ifluatex
      \xeluatextrue
    \else
      \xeluatexfalse
    \fi
  \fi

% Handle Unicode intelligently.
  % For XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX, nothing fancy should be required
  \ifxeluatex
    \relax

  % For pdfLaTeX, setup the input encoding.
  \else
    \RequirePackage[utf8]{inputenc}
  \fi


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% DEFAULT PACKAGES
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Inclusion of figures should always happen via graphicx
  \RequirePackage[final]{graphicx}

% Provide nicer table handling by default
  \RequirePackage{tabularx}
  \RequirePackage{booktabs}

% Improve captions on both figures and tables
  \RequirePackage[
    font=footnotesize,
    labelfont=bf
  ]{caption}

% Have List of Figures, List of Tables, and Bibliography show up in the
% Table of Contents.
  \RequirePackage[nottoc]{tocbibind}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% U OF M FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%
%% MARGINS

% Left is 1.5in, others are 1in.
  \RequirePackage{geometry}
  \geometry{
    paper = letterpaper, % Use US letter paper
    includeheadfoot,     % Nothing can appear in the margins, so force
                         % all content to live within the body.
    margin = 1.0in,      % Set margins to 1.0in,
    left   = 1.5in,      % and then override for left only.
  }

%%%%%%%%%
%% FONTS

% Use Type1 fonts.
  \RequirePackage[T1]{fontenc}

% The choice of fonts is highly restrictive:
%
% The only acceptable serif font is Times New Roman, and sans-serif must be
% either Helvetica or Arial. STIX provides Times-compatible text font and a
% matching math font.
  \RequirePackage{stix}
  \RequirePackage[scaled=0.92]{helvet}
  \RequirePackage{courier}

% The author's opinion is that the STIX summation symbol is highly inferior
% to those in Computer Modern/Latin Modern. Use CM since it provides a symbol
% which is slightly larger than LM, and therefore matches the rest of STIX a
% bit better.

  % Load Computer Modern into the math font tables
  \DeclareSymbolFont{cmlargesymbols}{OMX}{cmex}{m}{n}
  % Map the summation operator into the LM font
  \DeclareMathSymbol{\sumop}{\mathop}{cmlargesymbols}{"50}

% Similarly, the \ell (small script L) character in STIX has the beginning
% of the loop far to high up the character (nearly half-way). CM's looks
% quite a bit better, but it is slightly too light compared to STIX. The
% glyph in Palatino, though, is a reasonable compromize.

  % Small Script L substitution:
  %     Loads Palatino and assigns \ell to use it instead.
  \DeclareSymbolFont{plletters}{OML}{zplm}{m}{it}
  \DeclareMathSymbol{\ell}{\mathalpha}{plletters}{"60}

%%%%%%%%%%%
%% SPACING

% Only double or 1.5 spacing are permitted. The setspace package defines the
% spacings more compactly than i.e. Word does, so go with double spacing by
% default.
  \RequirePackage{setspace}
  \doublespacing
  % Typeset display math in single spacing mode, though. This is particularly
  % important when writing out matrices.
  \AtEndPreamble{%
      \makeatletter%
      \everydisplay=\expandafter{%
          \the\everydisplay\def\baselinestretch{1}\selectfont%
      }%
      \makeatother%
  }

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% PAGINATION

% Pages must use Arabic numerals. This will be setup after typesetting the
% front matter.

% In addition to the standard \title and \author commands, we need to have
% \institution, \advisor, \month, and \year commands for various bits of
% information needed on the title page.
  \global\let\umnthesis@institution\@empty
  \global\let\umnthesis@advisor\@empty

  \newcommand{\thesismonth}[1]{\gdef\umnthesis@month{#1}}
  \newcommand{\thesisyear}[1]{\gdef\umnthesis@year{#1}}
  % Furthermore, undefine \date since we won't allow it to prevent mistakes.
  \let\date\@undefined
  \let\@date\@undefined

% Use "Table of Contents" instead of "Contents"
  \renewcommand{\contentsname}{Table of Contents}
% Also provide redefinable macros setting the Abstract, Acknowledgments, and
% Dedication pages as well.
  \providecommand{\abstractname}{Abstract}
  \providecommand{\acknowledgmentsname}{Acknowledgments}
  \providecommand{\dedicationname}{Dedication}

% Redefine the abstract command to hold its argument for printing in the
% front matter.
  \DeclareRobustCommand{\abstract}[1]{\gdef\@abstract{#1}}
  \newcommand{\printabstract}{%
    \ifdef{\@abstract}{%
      \chapter*{\abstractname}%

      }
    }
  }

% Then make similar macros to provide optional Acknowledgments and
% Dedication sections.
%
%   These are both optional, though, so print nothing if the internal text
%   macro is undefined (signalling that the author didn't call it).

  \DeclareRobustCommand{\acknowledgments}[1]{\gdef\@acknowledgments{#1}}

%% BIBLIOGRAPHY

% Few restrictions are placed on the bibliography, so just load biblatex with
% biber enabled by default. Then let the user control any further settings.

  \RequirePackage[backend=biber]{biblatex}
  % Note that the tocbibind package can't automatically add the bibliography
  % heading to the Table of Contents after loading this, so you should
  % print out the bibliography using
  %
  %   \printbibliography[heading=bibintoc]
  %
  % to achieve that.

%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% GLOSSARY

\ifumnthesis@glossary
  % glossaries must be loaded after hyperref. Since hyperref will push itself
  % onto the top of the AtEndPreamble stack, we can just append to the end
  % and still have operations execute in the correct order.
  \AtEndPreamble{%
    \RequirePackage[
        xindy,
        toc,
        nopostdot,

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% OPTIONAL FORMATTING CHANGES
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Use microtype enhancements to make the visual appearance as nice as possible.
  \RequirePackage[final]{microtype}

% Patch \bfseries to also switch math into bold mode. This is really useful
% for situations like having math in a section heading which may or may not
% be bolded.
  \xapptocmd{\bfseries}{\boldmath}{}{}

% Use PDF hyperlinks. Load this at the end of the preamble as required by the
% hyperref documentation.
%
% IMPORTANT NOTE!
%   It took much debugging to figure out that biblatex makes use of the
%   \AtEndPreamble command to finalize much of its setup, especially with
%   respect to knowing if hyperref has been loaded or not. For this reason,
%   loading hyperref with \AtEndPreamble as well *after* we've already loaded
%   biblatex means the the code below is executed after code that biblatex
%   has loaded into the hook.
%
%   To get around this, we can instead *prepend* our code to the hook that
%   \AtEndPreamble normally appends to. We do this by patching a copy of the
%   command to use \gpreto instead of \gappto.
%
  \let\PreAtEndPreamble\AtEndPreamble%
  \patchcmd{\PreAtEndPreamble}{\gappto}{\gpreto}{}{%
    \ClassError{umnthesis}{%
      Prepending to the \verb|\AtEndPreamble| hook failed. Could not setup
      hyperref correctly.
    }{%
      Loading hyperref is a tricky business, and our attempt to have hyperref
      load at the correct time when also using biblatex failed. A guess would
      be that the format of the \verb|\AtEndPreamble| command has changed,
      which means our attempt to patch a copy for our purposes has failed.

% matter based on various settings that must be set within the preamble.

% Note that we use \AfterEndPreamble rather than \AtDocumentBegin. There is a

% of sync with the LaTeX page numbers. See etoolbox documentation for details
% on how the two commands differ.
