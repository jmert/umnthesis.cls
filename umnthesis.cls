%% LATEX SETUP
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Load some packages and create settings which will be assumed to exist from
% here on out for their great utility:
  \RequirePackage{etoolbox}
  \RequirePackage{xpatch}

% We will always assume at the very least the pdfLaTeX is in use. To permit
% possible specialization for XeLaTex and LuaLaTeX, create a new boolean that
% identifies these advanced engines simultaneously.
  \RequirePackage{ifxetex}
  \RequirePackage{ifluatex}
  \newif\ifxeluatex
  \ifxetex
    \xeluatextrue
  \else
    \ifluatex
      \xeluatextrue
    \else
      \xeluatexfalse
    \fi
  \fi

% Handle Unicode intelligently.
  % For XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX, nothing fancy should be required
  \ifxeluatex
    \relax

  % For pdfLaTeX, setup the input encoding.
  \else
    \RequirePackage[utf8]{inputenc}
  \fi


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% DEFAULT PACKAGES

% Inclusion of figures should always happen via graphicx
  \RequirePackage{graphicx}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%
%% MARGINS

% Left is 1.5in, others are 1in.
  \RequirePackage{geometry}
  \geometry{
    paper = letterpaper, % Use US letter paper
    includeheadfoot,     % Nothing can appear in the margins, so force
                         % all content to live within the body.
    margin = 1.0in,      % Set margins to 1.0in,
    left   = 1.5in,      % and then override for left only.
  }

%%%%%%%%%
%% FONTS

% Use Type1 fonts.
  \RequirePackage[T1]{fontenc}

% The choice of fonts is highly restrictive:
%
% The only acceptable serif font is Times New Roman, and sans-serif must be
% either Helvetica or Arial. STIX provides Times-compatible text font and a
% matching math font.
  \RequirePackage{stix}

% The author's opinion is that the STIX summation symbol is highly inferior
% to those in Computer Modern/Latin Modern. Use CM since it provides a symbol
% which is slightly larger than LM, and therefore matches the rest of STIX a
% bit better.

  % Load Computer Modern into the math font tables
  \DeclareSymbolFont{cmlargesymbols}{OMX}{cmex}{m}{n}
  % Map the summation operator into the LM font
  \DeclareMathSymbol{\sumop}{\mathop}{cmlargesymbols}{"50}

% Similarly, the \ell (small script L) character in STIX has the beginning
% of the loop far to high up the character (nearly half-way). CM's looks
% quite a bit better, but it is slightly too light compared to STIX. The
% glyph in Palatino, though, is a reasonable compromize.

  % Small Script L substitution:
  %     Loads Palatino and assigns \ell to use it instead.
  \DeclareSymbolFont{plletters}{OML}{zplm}{m}{it}
  \DeclareMathSymbol{\ell}{\mathalpha}{plletters}{"60}

%%%%%%%%%%%
%% SPACING

% Only double or 1.5 spacing are permitted. The setspace package defines the
% spacings more compactly than i.e. Word does, so go with double spacing by
% default.
  \RequirePackage{setspace}
  \doublespacing
  % Typeset display math in single spacing mode, though. This is particularly
  % important when writing out matrices.
  \AtEndPreamble{%
      \makeatletter%
      \everydisplay=\expandafter{%
          \the\everydisplay\def\baselinestretch{1}\selectfont%
      }%
      \makeatother%
  }

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% PAGINATION

% Pages must use Arabic numerals. This will be setup after typesetting the
% front matter.

% In addition to the standard \title and \author commands, we need to have
% \institution, \advisor, \month, and \year commands for various bits of
% information needed on the title page.
  \global\let\@institution\@empty
  \global\let\@advisor\@empty
  \global\let\@month\@empty
  \global\let\@year\@empty
  \def\institution#1{\gdef\@institution{#1}}
  \def\advisor#1{\gdef\@advisor{#1}}
  \def\month#1{\gdef\@month{#1}}
  \def\year#1{\gdef\@year{#1}}
  % Furthermore, undefine \date since we won't allow it to prevent mistakes.
  \let\date\@undefined
  \let\@date\@undefined

% Use "Table of Contents" instead of "Contents"
  \renewcommand{\contentsname}{Table of Contents}

% Redefine the abstract command to hold its argument for printing in the
% front matter.
  \DeclareRobustCommand{\abstract}[1]{\gdef\@abstract{#1}}
  \newcommand{\printabstract}{%
    \chapter*{Abstract}%
    \@abstract%
  }

%% BIBLIOGRAPHY

% Few restrictions are placed on the bibliography, so just load biblatex with
% biber enabled by default. Then let the user control any further settings.

  \RequirePackage[backend=biber]{biblatex}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% OPTIONAL FORMATTING CHANGES
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Use microtype enhancements to make the visual appearance as nice as possible.
  \RequirePackage{microtype}

% Use PDF hyperlinks. Load this at the end of the preamble as required by the
% hyperref documentation.
%
% IMPORTANT NOTE!
%   It took much debugging to figure out that biblatex makes use of the
%   \AtEndPreamble command to finalize much of its setup, especially with
%   respect to knowing if hyperref has been loaded or not. For this reason,
%   loading hyperref with \AtEndPreamble as well *after* we've already loaded
%   biblatex means the the code below is executed after code that biblatex
%   has loaded into the hook.
%
%   To get around this, we can instead *prepend* our code to the hook that
%   \AtEndPreamble normally appends to. We do this by patching a copy of the
%   command to use \gpreto instead of \gappto.
%
  \let\PreAtEndPreamble\AtEndPreamble%
  \patchcmd{\PreAtEndPreamble}{\gappto}{\gpreto}{}{%
    \ClassError{umnthesis}{%
      Prepending to the \verb|\AtEndPreamble| hook failed. Could not setup
      hyperref correctly.
    }{%
      Loading hyperref is a tricky business, and our attempt to have hyperref
      load at the correct time when also using biblatex failed. A guess would
      be that the format of the \verb|\AtEndPreamble| command has changed,
      which means our attempt to patch a copy for our purposes has failed.
